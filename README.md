## Installation and running locally
After you cloned the repository, you can run the docker by this command
- run ```docker-compose up --build -d```

After this, you can view the API documentation on
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/docs/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/docs/)

```usage_types ``` table is automatically preloaded using data migration. ```users``` and ```usage``` need to be created using API.

It took me around 3 hours to build this. Actually, didn't have any specific challenges.
